### CAD Test Part 1 - Swing Arm

#### I made a swing arm which was the goal of the assignment, check it out:  <!-- Description -->

*Gif of the swing arm Mr. Helmstetter made inside of my document*

##### I went through the assignment to create a swing arm, but ran into many challenges. One of these challenges being how to use variables. I learned some new things along the way though, mostly contraints like Parrallel and Perpendicular. Mr. Helmstetter re-made a swing arm to show me, and the people around me, how to better make the swing arm. This was really helpful, even if I only understood half the thing he was saying. <!-- Reflection -->

### Skateboard Assignment

#### Description - a clear description of what you did (what were the goals of the assignment?)
#### Evidence - embedded Arduino code or working link to Onshape document
#### Image - a picture of your circuit/TinkerCAD wiring diagram or 3D CAD model
#### Reflection - some thoughts on what you learned and the process of learning it (don't skimp on this section!)

### Lego Brick Assignemnt

#### I made a lego bricks inside of OnShape and used them to make a duck: <!-- Description -->
