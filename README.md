## CAD Test Part 1 - Swing Arm

#### I made a swing arm which was the goal of the assignment, check it out:  <!-- Description -->

### Reflection of the assignment:

##### I went through the assignment to create a swing arm, but ran into many challenges. One of these challenges being how to use variables. I learned some new things along the way though, mostly contraints like Parrallel and Perpendicular. Mr. Helmstetter re-made a swing arm to show me, and the people around me, how to better make the swing arm. This was really helpful, even if I only understood half the thing he was saying. <!-- Reflection -->

## Skateboard Assignment

The goal of this assignment was to make a skatboard, here is what came out in the end: ( !Spoiler, a skateboard! ) <!-- Description -->

### Reflection of the assignment: 

##### In this assignment I learned many things, but one thing I found really cool is replicate. This allows you to basically multiply something on an axis, which is basically magic for me. I struggled on how to make the truck baseplate and broke it many times. Eventually I got it to where it needed to be. I also struggled on how to get a logo on the board. I got one on there, but it is just a picture and not actually extruded into the board.

## Lego Brick Assignemnt

#### I made a bunch of lego bricks inside of OnShape and used them to make a duck: <!-- Description -->

### Reflection of the assignment:

##### The process of learning through the small videos was helpful as most times I question if I am doing something in the intented way. The snapping of the bricks was by far the best thing out of all of this. Just putting something together like that feels really cool and makes you feel proud of your work, even if it seems small to others.

### Multi-Tool Protractor:

#### I made a Procractor/Multi-tool: <!-- Description -->

### Reflection of the assignment:
I found this assignment easier compared to the previous assignments and I found that linear patterns helped a bit when making this. A Linear pattern took 1 hole and turned it into 8. Making 8 holes individually would take a lot longer. There was nothing that was "challenging" apart from me mistyping a measurement.
